â”œâ”€â”€ public/ # Static files (CSS, images, etc.)

## ðŸ–¼ Pages ðŸ–¼
- **Home:** Welcome message + upcoming events
- **About:** Info about the team/club
- **Events:** List of club events (from array in backend)
- **Contact:** Contact form (name, email, message)
- **Thank You:** Confirmation page after submitting form

## ðŸ§  How It Works ðŸ§ 
- Events and About info are pulled from arrays in the backend
- Contact form uses POST method and stores data in a temp array
- EJS is used to dynamically render data into templates
- Header and footer are reused across all pages using partials

## âœ… Features âœ…
- Dynamic content rendering
- Form submission with validation
- Clean, modular routing
- Git version control for collaboration

## ðŸ™Œ Reflection 
This project helped us understand routing, templating, and real-world collaboration using Git. We learned how to work as a team and build a complete web app from scratch.
